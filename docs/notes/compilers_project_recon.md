### Some other things to remember
    - Remove ambiguity, left recursion and perform left factoring for the
      productions that need to be modified.
    - Make the grammar LL(1) compatible.
    - To Avoid hard coding of rules, keep the grammar in one file and populate
      the data structure representing the grammar.
    - We must use the GCC C compiler for Ubuntu Linux (the one used in the IPC
      lab computers).
